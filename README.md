GettingCleaningData Course Project
===================
In this repo, you will find an R script called 'run_analysis.R'. This script is a fulfillment of the assigned course project for Getting and Cleaning Data on Coursera.org.

When run in R, the script will download a data set from the web and tidy it up.  The resulting tidy data set is a data frame called 'tidycast'.  This data frame reports the average values of many recorded physical parameters acquired during testing of multiple subjects doing six diferent types of activities.

The file called 'CodeBook.md' provides rationale for the steps taken to tidy up the data set.  Included therein are explanations of specific portions of the 'run_analysis.R' code as well as variable descriptions.
