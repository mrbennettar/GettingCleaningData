## Code book for Getting and Cleaning Data course project

This code book accompanies the script created for the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data course on coursera.org. The task was to create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

This code book provides the techniques and rationale used to process the provided data sets and turn them into one, usable tidy data set.
